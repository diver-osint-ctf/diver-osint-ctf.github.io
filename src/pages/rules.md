Not everyone in the team needs to be on Discord, but at least one representative needs to be reachable.

You can use AI services such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude for **research purpose** as long as you (or AI services) do not violate the prohibitions (Please note that any automated access to the CTF server is prohibited.). However, you are responsible for any violations that occur when the AI agent is operated autonomously by you.

In addition, when submitting queries or objections to flags, those that **only** source AI output results will be rejected. For example, "Wouldn't the information on this web page also qualify as flag?" will be validated (it means the admin team will investigate), but queries such as "ChatGPT says like this. could this also be a flag?" will be rejected.
